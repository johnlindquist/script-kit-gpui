# Bun configuration for Script Kit GPUI
#
# @johnlindquist/kit Import Redirect
# ----------------------------------
# Scripts can use `import "@johnlindquist/kit"` and it resolves to our local SDK.
# This is achieved via a postinstall script in package.json that creates a symlink
# at node_modules/@johnlindquist/kit -> scripts/kit-sdk.ts
#
# The symlink is created automatically when running `bun install` or `npm install`.
# This allows scripts to have editor type hints from the package while actually
# loading our new SDK implementation.
#
# Note: Bun's bunfig.toml doesn't support path aliasing for external packages.
# The package.json postinstall approach is the reliable solution.
